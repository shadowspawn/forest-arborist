## Overview

Work with a forest of repositories as easily as using a single repo: from `fab clone`, through `fab pull` and `fab status`, to custom commands.

Supports Git and Mercurial repositories. Tested on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Aims to be lightweight and coexist with other tooling, rather than intrusive and opinionated. Adds a manifest file in the seed repo and a marker file at the root of the forest.

Most commands can be run from anywhere in the forest.

Terminology:

- _forest_: a collection of repositories and their working trees
- _root_: directory at the root of the forest
- _manifest_: lists dependent repositories and forest configuration
- _seed_ repository: where the manifest is stored

## Installation

Requires `node` and `npm`.

    npm install --global @shadowspawn/forest-arborist
    fab help

## Forest Management Commands

To add `fab` to an existing forest you run `init` from the seed repo where you want the manifest to be stored.

- `fab init --nested` from root repo for a nested forest
- `fab init --sibling` from seed repo for a sibling forest, with root up one directory

You `clone` a seed repo to get the forest. This uses the manifest to find the dependent repos and forest layout.

    fab clone ssh://user@host:/path

If you have more than one combination of repos you use, such as different
platform libraries or production vs development, you can specify a manifest name:

    fab init --sibling --manifest mac
    fab clone --manifest mac ssh://user@host:/path

To (re)install dependent repos if the manifest has changed, or install dependent repos after cloning just the seed repo:

    fab install

## Utility Commands

To see a compact status listing for each repo in the forest:

    fab status

To pull new changesets:

    fab pull

There are two commands which take an explicit additional command to run across the forest. A `--` is used to mark the end of the `fab` options, and is optional if there are no options in the additional command. (_free_ is explained in [Dependent Repository Types](#dependent-repository-types))

    fab for-each git remote -v
    fab for-free git branch

There are two commands which run specifically `git` or `hg` commands across the forest repositories of matching type:

    fab git remote -v
    fab hg summary

## Working With Branches

You can specify the starting branch when you make the clone:

    fab clone --branch develop ssh://user@host:/path

There are commands to make a new branch and to switch to an existing branch:

    fab make-branch feature/bells
    fab make-branch --publish feature/working-with-others
    fab switch trunk

The branch commands operate on the _free_ repositories, and not the _pinned_ or _locked_ repositories. (See [Dependent Repository Types](#dependent-repository-types).)

## Reproducing Forest State

There are three commands for reproducing forest state:

- `snapshot` produces a listing of the current forest and changesets
- `restore` takes the current forest back to the snapshot state
- `recreate` is like clone but takes a snapshot file

Example commands:

    fab snapshot --output ~/snapshot1
    git pull
    fab restore ~/snapshot1
    cd ~/sandpit
    fab recreate ~/snapshot1 myTempRepo

## Dependent Repository Types

Some of the repositories you work with are actively developed along with the seed repo,
while some might actively track the release branch of a library, and some should stay fixed
at a specific version.

The dependent repos can be configured in three ways:

- _pinned_ to a specified changeset or tag
- _locked_ to a specified branch
- _free_ to follow the seed repo

The various commands operate on an appropriate subset of the repos. For example
the switch command only affects the _free_ repositories, the pull command affects
_free_ and _locked_, and the status command runs on all the repos.

## Manifest Files (Internals)

The manifest specifies the forest layout and the dependent repository details. The manifest file can be automatically generated by:

- `fab init --nested` from root repository for a nested forest
- `fab init --sibling` from seed repo for a sibling forest
- `fab init --sibling --manifest name` to save a custom manifest

You can manage the manifest contents with the `manifest` command:

- `fab manifest path` show path to manifest
- `fab manifest edit` open manifest in editor
- `fab manifest list` list dependencies from manifest
- `fab manifest add newRepo` add entry to manifest dependencies
- `fab manifest delete staleRepo` delete entry from manifest dependencies

The _dependencies_ map is where you might do some hand editing. The map key
is the working directory relative to the root of the forest. The properties are:

- origin: remote repo. Either absolute or relative to the seed origin.
- repoType: "git" or "hg"
- pinRevision: if pinned, changeset or tag
- lockBranch: if locked, branch name

Example:

```json
{"dependencies": {
    "Libs/Locked": {
    "origin": "git@github.com:Person/Locked.git ",
    "repoType": "git",
    "lockBranch": "trunk"
    },
    "Libs/Pinned": {
    "origin": "git@github.com:Person/Pinned.git ",
    "repoType": "git",
    "pinRevision": "ce12a1b401e72f7808ab3da7a696a5ab4cd364fe"
    },
    "RelativeFree": {
    "origin": "../relative-to-seed.git",
    "repoType": "git"
    }
},
"rootDirectory": ".",
"seedPathFromRoot": "."
}
```

The manifests are stored in the `.fab` folder of the seed repo.
Custom manifests follow the template &lt;custom&gt;\_manifest.json.

## Command-line Tab Completion

To install command-line tab completion, write the output of `fab completion` to a suitable location to be executed, whether via your shell startup file or in a location which is read by the system. See `fab completion` for installation examples.
(c.f. [npm completion](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/completion))

## Colour Output

Colour output is off by default on Windows and on by default for other platforms. You can explicitly enable or disable colour using [FORCE_COLOR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk#chalksupportscolor), or disable colour using [NO_COLOR](http://no-color.org).
