## Patterns

Version Plan

- Use different versions on main (published) and develop (linked work in progress).
- Tag version on main to match the published version.
- Do not tag version on develop since changes. Use prerelease on develop.
- See release command, which follows `np` style steps to prepare and check and release a version to npm and github.

Terminology Inspirations

- git
- Mercurial
